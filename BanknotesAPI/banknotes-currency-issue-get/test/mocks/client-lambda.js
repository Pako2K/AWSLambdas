The exchange rate to the reichsmark was 1:1, limited to 150 schilling per person. \r\nAlthough the euro became the official currency of Austria in 1999, euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002. Old schilling denominated coins and notes were phased out from circulation because of the introduction of the euro by 28 February of that year.
